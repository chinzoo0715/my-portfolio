# Welcome to the Dev Cave!

This ain't your Silicon Valley startup's portfolio site. Here, you'll find the humble abode of a coder who escapes the glow of the screen by getting sweaty... pixels are optional outdoors. ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∑Ô∏è

Built with the caffeine-fueled fury of Next.js, this site is a testament to my attempts at not breaking the internet. (So far, so good...)

**So, who am I?**

I'm your just coder with a not-so-average love for lycra, chlorine, and occasionally wiping out on a snowy mountain.  When I'm not battling browser bugs, you'll find me conquering hills on my trusty bicycle, doing my best aquatic impression in a pool, or perfecting my (slightly ungraceful) snow plow technique.

**But hey, enough about me! What's this site all about?**

About Me: (You are already here... unless you skipped ahead, in which case, go back and read this part!)
Projects: Behold! A showcase of my digital creations, from the useful (hopefully) to the "why did I even make this?"
Contact: If you need a developer who can code circles around a hamster on a caffeine bender, hit me up! (But seriously, feel free to reach out.) ‚òïÔ∏è

**Disclaimer:** This site may contain traces of self-deprecating humor, questionable jokes, and enough emojis to make your eyes water. Consider it a hazard of the trade.

**Deployment:**

This magnificent beast is deployed using some dark magic and a sprinkle of Firebase magic. Don't ask me how it works, I just make the pretty things dance. ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚ú®

**Feel free to:**

**Fork it!** Play around, make it own, and unleash your inner developer! (Just remember to credit the original creator, that's me.)

**Leave an issue!** Found a bug? Witness a typo of epic proportions? Let me know, I'm always learning (and slightly terrified of typos).
